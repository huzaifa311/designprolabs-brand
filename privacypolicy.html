            <h3>About The Policy</h3>
            <p>
              At Design Pro Labs., the privacy of our clients is our top priority and our website www.designprolabs.com
              duly respects it. Though we collect information from our clients, it is only used to make improvements in
              our customer services. Our company acknowledges that the maintenance and use of our clients' information
              is our responsibility. We DO NOT rent or sell the information that our clients provide us online.


              <br />
              This policy describes how the personal information of our client collected by us is used, why we collect
              it, and how we use it. It is within our policy that we describe the choices you can make about how we can
              collect and use your information.


            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 35px;">Personal Information Collected</h3>
            <p>includes the client's name, email, mailing address and phone number. These are pieces of information that
              the client provides to us while ordering or while saving the information with our company. We may also use
              the email addresses or mailing addresses which we receive through our mailing system such as our Contact
              Us Form for responding to comments, queries etc.
              <br>
              Our company also maintains records of the items, which have interested our clients in the past, as well as
              the client's purchases online.


            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 35px;">Use of Collected Data</h3>
            <p>
              The information collected is used in many diversified ways. Our company uses the information saved by our
              clients to process their order. We also send them emails to confirm the order and our customer services
              may also contact them via phone, mailing address or email, if our company has other queries regarding the
              order placed.


              <br />
              As a client, one might also receive updates regarding our Site and services, which may include a
              newsletter and information on promotions. In addition, we may also use the information about your
              interests and purchases to help our company improve our site design and the client's purchasing
              experience.

              <br />

              If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt out of
              receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter, or communicating to us by email
              or call at (737) 910-3666.

            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 35px;">Social Media (Features) and Widgets</h3>
            <p>Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button [and Widgets, such as the
              Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site]. These Features may collect your IP
              address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function
              properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our
              Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing
              it.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 35px;">3rd Party Sharing</h3>
            <p>
              Personal information will NOT be released to third parties unless as described in this policy. There are
              no circumstances under which we sell personal information to third parties.
              <br>
              We use credit card processing companies to bill you for services. These companies do not retain, share,
              store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. We also use Live Person to
              provide live customer support chat on our website. These companies are authorized to use your personal
              information only as necessary to provide these services to us.


            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 35px;">Security of Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
              The information of our clients is secure, as it is protected during transmission by the use of the Secure
              Sockets Layer (SSL) Software which encrypts the information the client puts in.

              <br>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us,
              both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
              electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable
              means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

              <br>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send an email to us at
              support@designprolabs.com


            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 35px;">Cookies and Their Use</h3>
            <p>
              Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to the clients' hard drives through their web
              browsers. This enables our systems to recognize the clients' browsers and ensure storage of items in their
              Shopping Carts during visits.

              <br>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will be more helpful in explaining how to prevent the
              browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify the user when a new cookie is received,
              or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the top
              features at our Site, and our company's personal recommendation is that the client accepts them.

              <br>Second, we keep track of your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer
              our website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your
              location and your Internet service provider. We may also collect combined information on how our users are
              utilizing the Site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site and search
              queries. No IP address/log file information is tied to Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

              <br>Third, we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors visit our Site, and URLs viewed by
              visitors while on our Site. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not provide this
              information to third parties, except in combined form.

              <br>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not
              covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners,
              affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you
              to navigate our Site.


            </p>

            <p>
              With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you want your testimonial
              removed, please contact us.
            </p>

              Our Site includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of ours. If you

              statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 35px;">Notification of the Changes in Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
              If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the
              homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how
              we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this
              privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy,
              we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage before the change takes effect.
